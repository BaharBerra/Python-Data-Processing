# Python Data Processing - Laboratory Works

## Overview

This repository contains the results and implementations of various laboratory works from the **Python Data Processing** course. The tasks span a variety of topics, including data exploration and visualization, image processing, and handling of real-world datasets. The labs focus on using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, OpenCV, and Matplotlib to analyze, manipulate, and visualize data, as well as process and modify images.

## Laboratory Work 2: Data Exploration and Visualization with Python

**Date:** 03/10/2024  
**Instructor:** Svitlana Mykolaivna Kovalenko  
**Student:** Bahar Berra Uyar (KH-222ia.e)

### Objective
Develop skills in Python for data exploration and visualization using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The focus is on analyzing aircraft losses during the 2022 Ukraine-Russia war.

### Key Tasks
- Reading and processing a CSV dataset containing cumulative loss counts.
- Extracting the "aircraft" column and converting it into a NumPy array.
- Calculating daily aircraft losses using `np.diff()`.
- Identifying top 3 greatest daily losses.
- Calculating aircraft losses between June 1st and August 31st, 2024.
- Visualizing aircraft losses during the first year of the war.

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BaharBerra/Python-Data-Processing.git
